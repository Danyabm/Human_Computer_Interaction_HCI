WebFitt Study: Hand Dominance and Target Size Effects
A quantitative HCI study investigating how hand dominance and target quantity affect pointing task performance using touchpad input.
Study Design
Design Type: Within-subject experiment
Participants: 4 students (3 female, 1 male) - Mix of PhD and Master's students
Platform: WebFitt
Variables
Independent Variables:

Hand Dominance (Dominant vs. Non-Dominant)
Number of Targets (15 vs. 7)

Dependent Variables:

Task Completion Time
Error Rate (Click Errors)
Throughput

Control Variables:

Pointing Device: Touchpad (all participants at intermediate skill level)

Experimental Conditions
4 conditions tested (2×2 factorial design):

Dominant hand, 15 targets
Non-dominant hand, 15 targets
Dominant hand, 7 targets
Non-dominant hand, 7 targets

Trials: 3 repetitions per condition = 12 trials per participant
Duration: ~7-8 minutes per participant (excluding practice session)
Key Findings
Hand Dominance Effects

Completion Time: Dominant hand significantly faster (M=1198.87ms) than non-dominant (M=1485.95ms)
Statistical Significance: F > 1, p < 0.05 ✓
Error Rate: Lower with dominant hand (M=6.98) vs. non-dominant (M=2.78), but not statistically significant

Target Quantity Effects

Completion Time: Minimal difference between 15 targets (M=1353.49ms) and 7 targets (M=1331.33ms)
Statistical Significance: F < 1, ns (not significant)
Error Rate: No significant difference (15 targets: M=5.0, 7 targets: M=4.76)

Interaction Effects

No significant interaction between hand dominance and target quantity

Statistical Analysis

Two-Way ANOVA: Confirmed hand dominance as the only significant factor
Tukey HSD Post-hoc: Validated significant difference between dominant/non-dominant groups
Tools: Python statistical libraries

Limitations & Reflections

Sample Size: Small participant pool (n=4) limits generalizability
Order Effects: Fixed condition sequence may have influenced results
Compliance Issues: One participant used dominant hand for clicking during non-dominant trials
Remote Data Collection: 2 participants tested via Zoom without direct supervision
Participant Fatigue: Repetitive tasks reported as boring/exhausting
Recruitment Challenges: Difficulty finding willing participants
